RoboScope2.0 is a modular automated microscope designed to accelerate artificial intelligence. It introduces a new interface compared to the first project, enhancing the system's flexibility and performance. This updated version builds on the foundation of the previous project but offers a more advanced and efficient way to interact with the microscope's functionality.

Connection to the First Project:
RoboScope2.0 is inspired by [https://github.com/AHaoI111/RoBoScope], which laid the groundwork for developing modern microscope systems. The first project provided the basic functionality and architecture, while RoboScope2.0 improves on this by offering a more flexible and efficient interface system.
